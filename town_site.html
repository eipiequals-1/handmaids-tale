            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>The Republic of Gilead is part of what used to be the United States. It stretches along the east cost of North America. A few years ago, our framers noticed a decline in birthrates, caused by environmental disasters. After fighting the Second Civil War, we were able to separate a part of the United States for us, and we begin controlling reproduction for the better.</p>

            <h2>OUR SOCIETY</h2>
            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/scenetherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/The-Waterfords-House-from-The-Handmaids-Tale-Ontario.jpg?fit=987%2C494&ssl=1" id="house">
            <p>Single women in Gilead are to be married off, become a Martha, or a Handmaid. Otherwise, they will be classified as "Unwomen" and will be stripped of all human rights. Women in Gilead are not allowed to own property or know how to read. Marthas are servants for families, and Handmaids are responsible to produce offspring for the couple whom they work for.</p>
