            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <h7><em>I'm Offred</em></h7>
            <h2>WHO AM I</h2>
            <p>I am a handmaid. I am one of the remaining fertile women in Gilead whose job is to produce viable offspring for the Commander and his Wife. I live in the Republic of Gilead which replaces what was once the United States of America.</p>

            <h2>BEFORE</h2>
            <p>A long time ago, I was once married to a man named Luke. I loved him dearly, and I also once had a little girl. I lived a happy life, until I was robbed of my job and my property like all other women of the country. Luke, my daughter, and I decided to flee to Canada, but we were captured and have never seen each other ever since. I was then sent to a Red Center where I was taught lessons by a woman named Aunt Lydia about women's role as an obedient child bearer and becoming a handmaid.</p>

            <h2>LIFE IN THE COMMANDER'S HOUSE</h2>
            <p>I was finally assigned to the Commander's house to bear children for Serena Joy, his wife. Gradually, a routine formed. I would take shopping trips with Ofglen, my friend, and visit the doctor to check for diseases. Every month, I would have ritualized sexual intercourse with the Commander to try and have a baby.</p>
        
            <h2>CHANGES TO MY LIFE</h2>
            <p>One day, the Commander sent his gardener, Nick, to tell me to meet him at night in the Commanderâ€™s office. I went and played Scrabble. Before I left, he ended by asking me for a kiss, to which I reluctantly agreed. The visits to his office became more frequent and I grew closer to him. He gave me hand lotion and let me look at old magazines like Vogue.</p>

            <p>After several months where I did not become pregnant, Serena Joy asked me to be impregnated by Nick in return for a picture of my daughter. On the same night, the Commander smuggled me out to an illegal nightclub with prostitutes. I met my old friend from the Red Center, Moira, who had become one of the women at the nightclub. Later in the night, I had sexual intercourse with the Commander.</p>

            <h2>LATER YEARS</h2>
            <h4><b><em>The following is written by Professor Pieixoto as Offred did not get the chance to continue her biography.</em></b></h4>
            <p>Offred was shipped away in a black van, who were the secret police of Gilead. It is believed that Nick had arranged for her to escape the country.</p>
