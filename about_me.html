            <p>Hi, my name is Offred, and I'm a handmaid. I have a husband, Luke, and daughter who I have not seen in years, but I love them so much.</p>
            <p>I work for the Commander and his wife Serena Joy. I am so tired of them! I have no freedom! I wish I could just disappear and destroy Gilead!</p>
            <p>My dream is to be with my family again. Please help me get news of them if possible. Every day, I grow more depressed without my family. I really miss them! I can not bear this torture any longer!</p>

                <h7><em>I'm Offred</em></h7>

            <h2>WHO AM I</h2>
            <p>I am a handmaid of the Republic of Gilead which was once the east coast of the United States of America. My job in Gilead is to produce viable offspring for couples.</p>

            <h2>BEFORE</h2>
            <p>A few years ago, before the revolution, I was married to a man named Luke. I loved him dearly, and I also had a little girl. We had everything, and we were so happy. I lived a happy life, until I was robbed of my job and my property like all other women of the country. Luke, my daughter, and I decided to flee to Canada, but we were captured on the way and have never seen each other ever since. I was then sent to a Red Center where I was taught lessons by a woman named Aunt Lydia about women's role as an obedient child bearer and becoming a handmaid.</p>
            <p>Now, I have to wear a red dress with a white veil. I do not have any choice. I can not go out in public alone.</p>

            <h2>LIFE IN THE COMMANDER'S HOUSE</h2>
            <p>I was assigned to the Commander's house to bear children for Serena Joy, his wife. Gradually, a routine formed. I would take shopping trips with Ofglen, my handmaid friend, and visit the doctor.</p>

            <p>Every month, I would have try to be impregnated by the Commander and have a baby. Unfortunately for me, it was never successful.</p>
        
            <h2>CHANGES TO MY LIFE</h2>
            <p>One day, the Commander sent his gardener, Nick, to tell me to meet him at night in the Commanderâ€™s office. I went and played Scrabble. I felt amazing after my act of resistance against Gilead!</p>
            <p>Before I left, he asked me for a kiss, to which I reluctantly agreed. The visits to his office became more frequent and I grew closer to him. He gave me hand lotion and let me look at old, smuggled magazines like Vogue.</p>

            <p>After several months where I did not become pregnant, Serena Joy asked me to be impregnated by Nick in return for a picture of my daughter. I realized then, that Serena had always known where my daughter was. On the same night, the Commander smuggled me out to an illegal nightclub with elite men of Gilead. There, I understood that the Commander was very influential, and I had to be careful of making mistakes or get punished severely.</p>

            <h2>LATER YEARS</h2>
            <h4><b><em>The following is written by Professor Pieixoto as Offred did not get the chance to continue her biography.</em></b></h4>
            <p>Offred was shipped away in a black van, who were the secret police of Gilead. It is believed that Nick had arranged for her to escape the country.</p>
